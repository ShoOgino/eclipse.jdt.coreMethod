     * do an autobuild.  Thread A goes on to configure the project's
     * classpath; at the same time, thread B calls APT, which configures
     * the project's classpath.  Access to the classpath is not
     * synchronized, so there's a race for which thread's modification 
     * wins.  We work around this by disabling autobuild.
