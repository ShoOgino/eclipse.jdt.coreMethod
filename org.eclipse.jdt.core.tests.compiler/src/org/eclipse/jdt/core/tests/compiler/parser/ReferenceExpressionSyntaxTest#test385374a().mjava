	/* https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=385374, Support for 308 style type annotations on 335 constructs - make sure illegal modifiers are rejected
	   This test has been rendered meaningless as the grammar has been so throughly changed - Type annotations are not accepted via modifiers in the first place.
	   Disabling this test as we don't want fragile and unstable tests that are at the whimsy of the diagnose parser's complex algorithms.
