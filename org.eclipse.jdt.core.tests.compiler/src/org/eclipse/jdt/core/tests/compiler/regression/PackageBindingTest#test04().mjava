	 * This test checks if types are searched on creating a package, but without the search for secondary types.
	 * It isn't necessary to search for secondary types when creating a package, because a package name can not collide with a secondary type.
	 * The search for secondary types should not get executed, because the search for secondary types is very expensive regarding performance
	 * (all classes of a package have to get loaded, parsed and analyzed).
