/**
 * @bug 258798: [1.5][compiler] Return type should be erased after unchecked conversion during inference
 * @test Fix for this bug had side effects while reporting missing tags in javadoc comments.<br>
 * Following tests have been written to verify that noticed issues have been solved:
 * <ol>
 * <li>missing tags should be reported even when the method/constructor has
 * 	a &#064;see reference on itself</li>
 * <li>missing tag should be reported when superclass constructor has different
 * 	arguments (even if they are compatible)</li>
 * <li>missing tag should not be reported when method arguments are the same
 * 	even when the type argument is not the same</li>
 * </ol>
 * @see "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=258798"
