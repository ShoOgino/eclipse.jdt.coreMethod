	 * public class Example {
	 * 	final int a = 1;
	 * 	final boolean b = true;
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * Descriptions of parameters and return values are best appended at end of
	 * the javadoc comment.
	 * 
	 * @param a
	 * 	The first parameter. For an optimum result, this should be an odd number
	 * 	between 0 and 100.
	 * @param b
	 * 	The second parameter.
	 * @return The result of the foo operation, usually within 0 and 1000.
