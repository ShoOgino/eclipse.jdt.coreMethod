/**
 * Bug 83716: [search] refs to 2-arg constructor on Action found unexpected matches
 * @see "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=83716"
 * 
 * Note that this test does verify that bug is really fixed, but only that it has no impact
 * on existing behavior. It was not really possible to put a test in this suite to verify that
 * bug is effectively fixed as it appears only to potential match found in plugin dependencies...
