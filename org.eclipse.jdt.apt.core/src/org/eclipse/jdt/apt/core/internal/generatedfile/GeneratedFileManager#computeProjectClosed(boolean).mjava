	/**
	 * Clear the working copy maps, that is, the reconcile-time dependency information.
	 * Returns a list of working copies that are no longer referenced and should be
	 * discarded. Typically called when a project is being closed or deleted.
	 * <p>
	 * It's not obvious we actually need this. As long as the IDE discards the parent
	 * working copies before the whole GeneratedFileManager is discarded, there'll be
	 * nothing left to clear by the time we get here. This is a "just in case."
	 * <p>
	 * This method affects maps only; it does not touch disk nor create, modify, nor
	 * discard any working copies. This method is atomic with respect to data structure
	 * integrity.
	 * 
	 * @param deleteState
	 *            true if this should delete the serialized build dependencies.
	 *            
	 * @return a list of working copies which must be discarded by the caller
