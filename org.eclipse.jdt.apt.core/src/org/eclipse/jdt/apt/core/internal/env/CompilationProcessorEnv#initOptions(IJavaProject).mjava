	/**
     * Set the _options map based on the current project/workspace settings.
     * There is a bug in Sun's apt implementation: it parses the command line 
     * incorrectly, such that -Akey=value gets added to the options map as 
     * key "-Akey=value" and value "".  In order to support processors written 
     * to run on Sun's apt as well as processors written without this bug
     * in mind, we populate the map with two copies of every option, one the
     * expected way ("key" / "value") and the other the Sun way 
     * ("-Akey=value" / "").  We make exceptions for the non-dash-A options
     * that we set automatically, such as -classpath, -target, and so forth;
     * since these wouldn't have come from a -A option we don't construct a
     * -Akey=value variant.
     * 
     * Called from constructor.  A new Env is constructed for each build pass,
     * so this will always be up to date with the latest settings.
