/**
 * Returns the declared Java language modifiers, as specified in the declaration
 * of this class or interface, encoded in an integer. 
 * The modifiers consist of the Java Virtual Machine's constants 
 * for public, protected, private, and final; they should be decoded 
 * using the methods of class Modifier.
 * The result may not correspond to the modifiers in the compiled
 * binary, since the compiler may change them (in particular,
 * for inner classes).  The <code>getModifiers()</code>
 * method should be used if the compiled modifiers are needed.
 * Returns 0 if this type does not represent a class or interface.
 * 
 * <p>The modifier encodings are defined in <em>The Java Virtual
 * Machine Specification</em>, table 4.1.
