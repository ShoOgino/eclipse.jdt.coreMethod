	/**
	 * Returns an array of Type objects representing the
	 * classes in the given ImageContext which directly implement this interface.
	 * A class is said to directly implement this interface if the interface
	 * appears in the <code>implements</code> clause of the class's declaration.
	 * Although all array types are considered to implement the <code>Cloneable</code>
	 * interface, this method never returns array types, only class types.
	 * Returns an array of length 0 if this object does not represent
	 * an interface.
	 * The resulting Types are in no particular order.
	 * See <em>The Java Language Specification</em> section 8.1.4
	 * for more details.
	 * 
	 * @param imageContext the ImageContext in which to restrict the search.
	 * @exception NotPresentException if this interface is not present.
