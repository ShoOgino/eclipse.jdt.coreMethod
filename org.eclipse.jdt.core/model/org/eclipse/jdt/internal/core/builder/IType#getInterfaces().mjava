	/**
	 * Returns an array of Type objects representing the direct
	 * superinterfaces of the class or interface represented by this object. 
	 * <p>
	 * If this object represents a class, the return value is an array 
	 * containing objects representing all interfaces directly implemented by the 
	 * class. The order of the interface objects in the array corresponds 
	 * to the order of the interface names in the <code>implements</code> 
	 * clause of the declaration of the class represented by this object. 
	 * <p>
	 * If this object represents an interface, the array contains 
	 * objects representing all interfaces directly extended by the interface. 
	 * The order of the interface objects in the array corresponds to the 
	 * order of the interface names in the <code>extends</code> clause of 
	 * the declaration of the interface represented by this object. 
	 * <p>
	 * If the class or interface implements no interfaces, or if this 
	 * object represents neither a class nor an interface, this method 
	 * returns an array of length 0. 
	 *
		 * See <em>The Java Language Specification</em> sections 8.1.4 and 9.1.3
	 * for more details.
	 *
	 * @return	an array of interfaces implemented by this class.
	 * @exception NotPresentException if this class or interface is not present.
