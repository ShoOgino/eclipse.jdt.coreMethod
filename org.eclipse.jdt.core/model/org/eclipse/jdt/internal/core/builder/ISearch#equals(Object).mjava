 * Returns whether two ISearch objects are equal or not.
 * Two ISearch objects are considered to be equal if
 * they are the same object OR:
 * <ul>
 * <li> neither is equal to null AND
 * <li> both searches have the same kind (i.e.. search for type), name 
 *      (i.e., type named 'Foo') return type, number and type of parameters 
 *      (even if not used -- as in the case of search for type), and search 
 *      context (i.e., ISearchFactory.SEARCH_FOR_DECLS)
 * <li> their scopes are equal (contain the same IPackage and IType handles, in any order)
 * </ul>
