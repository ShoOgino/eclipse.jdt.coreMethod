	 * Determines if the specified Type object represents a primitive Java
	 * type.
	 * This is a handle-only method.
	 *
	 * <p>There are nine predefined Type objects to represent the eight
	 * primitive Java types and void.  These are created by the Java
	 * Virtual Machine, and have the same names as the primitive types
	 * that they represent, namely boolean, byte, char, short, int,
	 * long, float, and double, and void.
	 *
	 * <p>These objects may only be accessed via the following methods, 
	 * and are the only objects for which this method returns true.
