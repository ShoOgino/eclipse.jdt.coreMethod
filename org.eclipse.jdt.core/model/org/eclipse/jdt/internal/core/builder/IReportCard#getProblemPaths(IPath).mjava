/**
 * Returns the paths of resources whose built objects have problems.
 * Only objects having the given path, or having the given path 
 * as a prefix of their path, are considered.
 * Only objects within the scope of the report card's image context are considered.
 * If null is passed, all objects within the image context are considered.
 * Note that problems which have no path, such as problems reported against
 * the image itself, are not considered.  
 * To get all problems, use <code>getLeafProblemsFor(IPath path)</code> instead.
