 * Returns all resolved superclasses of the

 * is returned if there are no resolved superclasses for the
 * given class.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: once a type hierarchy has been created, it is more efficient to
 * query the hierarchy for superclasses than to query a class recursively up
 * the superclass chain. Querying an element performs a dynamic resolution,
 * whereas the hierarchy returns a pre-computed result.

 * @param type the given type
