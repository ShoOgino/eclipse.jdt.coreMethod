	/**
	 * Returns a new working copy with the given name using this working copy owner to
	 * create its buffer.
	 * <p>
	 * This working copy always belongs to the default package in a package
	 * fragment root that corresponds to its Java project, and this Java project never exists.
	 * However this Java project has the given classpath that is used when resolving names
	 * in this working copy.
	 * </p><p>
	 * A DOM AST created using this working copy will have bindings resolved using the given
	 * classpath, and problem are reported to the given problem requestor.
	 * <p></p>
	 * <code>JavaCore#getOptions()</code> is used to create the DOM AST as it is not
	 * possible to set the options on the non-existing Java project.
	 * </p><p>
	 * When the working copy instance is created, an {@link IJavaElementDelta#ADDED added delta} is
	 * reported on this working copy.
	 * </p><p>
	 * Once done with the working copy, users of this method must discard it using
	 * {@link ICompilationUnit#discardWorkingCopy()}.
	 * </p><p>
	 * Note that when such working copy is committed, only its buffer is saved (see
	 * {@link IBuffer#save(IProgressMonitor, boolean)}) but no resource is created.
	 * </p><p>
	 * This method is not intended to be overriden by clients.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param name the name of the working copy (e.g. "X.java")
	 * @param classpath the classpath used to resolve names in this working copy
	 * @param problemRequestor a requestor which will get notified of problems detected during
	 * 	reconciling as they are discovered. The requestor can be set to <code>null</code> indicating
	 * 	that the client is not interested in problems.
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor used to report progress while opening the working copy
	 * 	or <code>null</code> if no progress should be reported
	 * @throws JavaModelException if the contents of this working copy can
	 *   not be determined.
	 * @return a new working copy
	 * @see ICompilationUnit#becomeWorkingCopy(IProblemRequestor, IProgressMonitor)
	 * @since 3.2
	 *
	 * @deprecated Use {@link #newWorkingCopy(String, IClasspathEntry[], IProgressMonitor)} instead.
	 * 	Note that if this deprecated method is used, problems may be reported twice
	 * 	if the given requestor is not the same as the current working copy owner one.
