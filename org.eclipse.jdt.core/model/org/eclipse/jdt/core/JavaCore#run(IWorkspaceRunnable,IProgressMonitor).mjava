	 * Runs the given action as an atomic java model operation.
	 * <p>
	 * After running a method that modifies java elements,
	 * registered listeners receive after-the-fact notification of
	 * what just transpired, in the form of a element changed event.
	 * This method allows clients to call a number of
	 * methods that modify java elements and only have element
	 * changed event notifications reported at the end of the entire
	 * batch.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If this method is called outside the dynamic scope of another such
	 * call, this method runs the action and then reports a single
	 * element changed event describing the net effect of all changes
	 * done to java elements by the action.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If this method is called in the dynamic scope of another such
	 * call, this method simply runs the action.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param action the action to perform
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress
	 *    reporting and cancellation are not desired
	 * @exception CoreException if the operation failed.
