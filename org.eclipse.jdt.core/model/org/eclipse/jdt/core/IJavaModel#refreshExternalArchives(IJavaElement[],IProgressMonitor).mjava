 * Triggers an update of the JavaModel with respect to the referenced external archives.
 * This operation will issue a JavaModel delta describing the discovered changes, in term

 * Note that a collection of elements can be passed so as to narrow the set of archives
 * to refresh (passing <code>null</code> along is equivalent to refreshing the entire mode). 
 * The elements can be:
 * <ul>
 * <li> package fragment roots corresponding to external archives
 * <li> Java projects, which referenced external archives will be refreshed
 * <li> Java model, all referenced external archives will be refreshed.
 * </ul>
 * <p> In case an archive is used by multiple projects, the delta issued will account for
 * all of them. This means that even if a project was not part of the elements scope, it
 * may still be notified of changes if it is referencing a library comprised in the scope.
 * <p>
