	/**
	 * Returns the type-qualified name of this type, 
	 * including qualification for any enclosing types,

	 * This consists of the simple names of any enclosing types, 
	 * separated by the <code>enclosingTypeSeparator</code>, 
	 * followed by the simple name of this type.
	 * 
	 * For example:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>the type qualified name of a class B defined as a member of a class A
	 *     using the '.' separator is "A.B"</li>
	 * <li>the type qualified name of a class B defined as a member of a class A
	 *     using the '$' separator is "A$B"</li>
	 * <li>the type qualified name of a binary type whose class file is A$B.class
	 *     using the '.' separator is "A.B"</li>
	 * <li>the type qualified name of a binary type whose class file is A$B.class
	 *     using the '$' separator is "A$B"</li>
	 * <li>the type qualified name of an anonymous binary type whose class file is A$1.class
	 *     using the '.' separator is "A$1"</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * This is a handle-only method.
	 * 
	 * @param enclosingTypeSeparator the specified enclosing type separator
	 * @return the type-qualified name of this type
	 * @since 2.0
