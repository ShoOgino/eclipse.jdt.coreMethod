 *	a subsequent change in the resource</li>
 * <li> <code>false</code> - in this case a <code>JavaModelException</code> is thrown</li>

 * @param force a flag to handle the cases when the contents of the original resource have changed

 * @param monitor the given progress monitor
 * @exception JavaModelException if this working copy could not commit. Reasons include:

 * <li> This element is not a working copy (INVALID_ELEMENT_TYPES)
