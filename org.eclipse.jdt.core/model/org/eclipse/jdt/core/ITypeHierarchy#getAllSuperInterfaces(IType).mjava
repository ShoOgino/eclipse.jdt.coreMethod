/**
 * Returns all resolved superinterfaces (direct and indirect) of the given type.
 * If the given type is a class, this includes all superinterfaces of all superclasses.
 * An empty array is returned if there are no resolved superinterfaces for the
 * given type.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: once a type hierarchy has been created, it is more efficient to
 * query the hierarchy for superinterfaces than to query a type recursively.
 * Querying an element performs a dynamic resolution,
 * whereas the hierarchy returns a pre-computed result.
