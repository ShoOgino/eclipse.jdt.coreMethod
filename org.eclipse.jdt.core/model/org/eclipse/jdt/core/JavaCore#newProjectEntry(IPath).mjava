	 * Creates and returns a new non-exported classpath entry of kind <code>CPE_PROJECT</code>
	 * for the project identified by the given absolute path.
	 * <p>
	 * A project entry is used to denote a prerequisite project on a classpath.
	 * The referenced project will be contributed as a whole, either as sources (in the Java Model, it
	 * contributes all its package fragment roots) or as binaries (when building, it contributes its 
	 * whole output location).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * A project reference allows to indirect through another project, independently from its internal layout. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The prerequisite project is referred to using an absolute path relative to the workspace root.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The resulting entry is not exported to dependent projects. This method is equivalent to
	 * <code>newProjectEntry(path,false)</code>.
