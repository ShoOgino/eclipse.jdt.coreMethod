	 * Creates and returns a new classpath entry of kind <code>CPE_PROJECT</code>

	 * A project entry is used to denote a prerequisite project on a classpath.
	 * The referenced project will be contributed as a whole, either as sources (in the Java Model, it
	 * contributes all its package fragment roots) or as binaries (when building, it contributes its 
	 * whole output location).

	 * A project reference allows to indirect through another project, independently from its internal layout. 
	 * <p>
	 * The prerequisite project is referred to using an absolute path relative to the workspace root.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that by default the resulting entry is not exported (see <code>IClasspathEntry.isExported</code>).
	 * In order to create an exported project entry, use <code>JavaCore.newProjectEntry(IPath, boolean)</code>
	 * <p>
	 * @param path the absolute path of the prerequisite project
