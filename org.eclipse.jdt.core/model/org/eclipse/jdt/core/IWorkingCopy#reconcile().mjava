	/**
	 * Reconciles the contents of this working copy.
	 * It performs the reconciliation by locally caching the contents of 
	 * the working copy, updating the contents, then creating a delta 
	 * over the cached contents and the new contents, and finally firing
	 * this delta.
	 * <p>
	 * Returns the syntax problems found in the new contents as transient markers
	 * associated with the original element. Returns <code>null</code> if no problems were found.
	 * <p>
	 * Note: It has been assumed that added inner types should
	 * not generate change deltas.  The implementation has been
	 * modified to reflect this assumption.
	 *
	 * @exception JavaModelException if the contents of the original element
	 *		cannot be accessed. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> The original Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 * </ul>
