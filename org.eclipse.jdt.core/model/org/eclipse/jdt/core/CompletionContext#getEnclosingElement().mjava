	/**
	 * Returns the innermost enclosing Java element which contains the completion location or <code>null</code> if this element cannot be computed.
	 * The returned Java element and all Java elements in the same compilation unit which can be navigated to from the returned Java element are special Java elements:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>they are based on the current content of the compilation unit's buffer, they are not the result of a reconcile operation</li>
	 * <li>they are not updated if the buffer changes.</li>
	 * <li>they do not contain local types which are not visible from the completion location.</li>
	 * <li>they do not give information about categories. {@link IMember#getCategories()} will return an empty array</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * Reasons for returning <code>null</code> include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>the compilation unit no longer exists</li>
	 * <li>the completion occurred in a binary type. However this restriction might be relaxed in the future.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * @return the innermost enclosing Java element which contains the completion location or <code>null</code> if this element cannot be computed.

	 * @exception UnsupportedOperationException if the context is not an extended context
