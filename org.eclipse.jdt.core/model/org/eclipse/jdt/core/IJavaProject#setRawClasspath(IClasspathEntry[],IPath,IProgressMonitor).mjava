	/**
	 * Sets the both the classpath of this project and its output location at once.
	 * The classpath is defined using a list of classpath entries. In particular such a classpath may contain
	 * classpath variable entries. Classpath variable entries can be resolved individually (see <code>JavaCore#getClasspathVariable</code>),
	 * or the full classpath can be resolved at once using the helper method <code>getResolvedClasspath</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * A classpath variable provides an indirection level for better sharing a classpath. As an example, it allows
	 * a classpath to no longer refer directly to external JARs located in some user specific location. The classpath
	 * can simply refer to some variables defining the proper locations of these external JARs.
	 * <p>
	 * Setting the classpath to <code>null</code> specifies a default classpath
	 * (the project root). Setting the classpath to an empty array specifies an
	 * empty classpath.
	 * <p>
	 * If a cycle is detected while setting this classpath, an error marker will be added
	 * to the project closing the cycle.
	 * To avoid this problem, use <code>hasClasspathCycle(IClasspathEntry[] entries)</code>
	 * before setting the classpath.
	 *
	 * @exception JavaModelException if the classpath could not be set. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 * <li> Two or more entries specify source roots with the same or overlapping paths (NAME_COLLISION)
	 * <li> A entry of kind <code>CPE_PROJECT</code> refers to this project (INVALID_PATH)
	 *  <li>This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 *	<li>The output location path refers to a location not contained in this project (<code>PATH_OUTSIDE_PROJECT</code>)
	 *	<li>The output location path is not an absolute path (<code>RELATIVE_PATH</code>)
	 *  <li>The output location path is nested inside a package fragment root of this project (<code>INVALID_PATH</code>)
	 * <li> The classpath is being modified during resource change event notification (CORE_EXCEPTION)
	 * </ul>
	 * @see IClasspathEntry
