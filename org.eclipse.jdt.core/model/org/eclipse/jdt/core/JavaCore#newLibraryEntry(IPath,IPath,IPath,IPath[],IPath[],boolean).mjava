	/**
	 * Creates and returns a new classpath entry of kind <code>CPE_LIBRARY</code> for the JAR or folder
	 * identified by the given absolute path. This specifies that all package fragments within the root 
	 * will have children of type <code>IClassFile</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * A library entry is used to denote a prerequisite JAR or root folder containing binaries.
	 * The target JAR can either be defined internally to the workspace (absolute path relative
	 * to the workspace root) or externally to the workspace (absolute path in the file system).
	 * The target root folder can only be defined internally to the workspace (absolute path relative
	 * to the workspace root). To use a binary folder external to the workspace, it must first be
	 * linked (see IFolder#createLink(...)).
	 * <p>
	 * e.g. Here are some examples of binary path usage<ul>
	 *	<li><code> "c:/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib/rt.jar" </code> - reference to an external JAR</li>
	 *	<li><code> "/Project/someLib.jar" </code> - reference to an internal JAR </li>
	 *	<li><code> "/Project/classes/" </code> - reference to an internal binary folder</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Note that this operation does not attempt to validate or access the 
	 * resources at the given paths.
	 * <p>
	 * The <code>inclusionPatterns</code> and <code>exclusionPatterns</code> control which packages
	 * and type arising from this entry are available with the project itself.
	 * [TODO (jerome) - the spec for inclusionPatterns and exclusionPatterns is incomplete.
	 * Need to describe the format of the patterns and how there are applied.
	 * Nees to describe how package names and type names are mapper to IPaths.
	 * Nees to describe how wildcarding works.
	 * Need to cover what happens when one, the other, or both are empty.]
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The <code>isExported</code> flag indicates whether this entry is contributed to dependent
	 * projects. If not exported, dependent projects will not see any of the classes from this entry.
	 * [TODO (jerome) - check above specs for isExported, inclusionPatterns, and exclusionPatterns.]
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param path the absolute path of the binary archive
	 * @param sourceAttachmentPath the absolute path of the corresponding source archive or folder, 
	 *    or <code>null</code> if none. Note, since 3.0, an empty path is allowed to denote no source attachment.
	 *   and will be automatically converted to <code>null</code>.
	 * @param sourceAttachmentRootPath the location of the root within the source archive or folder
	 *    or <code>null</code> if this location should be automatically detected.
	 * @param inclusionPatterns the possibly empty list of inclusion patterns
	 *    represented as relative paths
	 * @param exclusionPatterns the possibly empty list of exclusion patterns
	 *    represented as relative paths
	 * @return a new library classpath entry
	 * @since 3.1
