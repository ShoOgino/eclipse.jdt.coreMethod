	 * To avoid this problem, use <code>hasClasspathCycle(IClasspathEntry[] entries)</code>

	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 * <li> Two or more entries specify source roots with the same or overlapping paths (NAME_COLLISION)
	 * <li> A entry of kind <code>CPE_PROJECT</code> refers to this project (INVALID_PATH)
	 * <li> The classpath is being modified during resource change event notification (CORE_EXCEPTION)
	 * </ul>
