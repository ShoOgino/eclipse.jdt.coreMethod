	 * 
	 * <p>The values of these options might be different from the values returned by {@link #getDefaultOptions()}

	 * (i.e. modified by the usage of a plugin_customization.ini file for example).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>These options allow to configure the behaviour of the underlying components.</p>

	 * <p>Helper constants have been defined on JavaCore for each of the option IDs
	 * (categorized in Code assist option ID, Compiler option ID and Core option ID)
	 * and some of their acceptable values (categorized in Option value). Some
	 * options accept open value sets beyond the documented constant values.</p>
