	 * The package name is a dot-separated name.

	 * a class B defined as a member type of a class A should have the
	 * type qualified name "A.B".

	 * Note that in order to be found, a type name (or its top level enclosing
	 * type name) must match its corresponding compilation unit name. As a
	 * consequence, secondary types cannot be found using this functionality.
	 * To find secondary types use {@link #findType(String, String, IProgressMonitor)}
	 * instead.
