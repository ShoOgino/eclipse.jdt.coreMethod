/**
 * Returns whether the element is consistent with its underlying resource or buffer.
 * The element is consistent when opened, and is consistent if the underlying resource
 * or buffer has not been modified since it was last consistent.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: Child consistency is not considered. For example, a package fragment
 * responds <code>true</code> when it knows about all of its
 * compilation units present in its underlying folder. However, one or more of
 * the compilation units could be inconsistent.
 *
 * @exception JavaModelException if this element does not exist or if an
 *		exception occurs while accessing its corresponding resource.
 * @return true if the element is consistent with its underlying resource or buffer, false otherwise.
