	 * When compiling test code in a modular project that has non-source classpath entries which don't have the
	 * {@link IClasspathAttribute#MODULE} set, the module is assumed to read the unnamed module (which is useful for
	 * test-only dependencies that should not be mentioned in the module-info.java). When executing test code that was
	 * compiled like this, corresponding "--add-reads" options need to be passed to the java runtime. This method
	 * returns the list of modules on the project's classpath for which this is the case.
	 * 
	 * @return the set of module names
	 * @throws JavaModelException
	 *             when access to the classpath or module description of the given project fails.
