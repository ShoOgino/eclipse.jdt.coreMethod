	 * Returns an array of classpath entries that are referenced directly or indirectly

	 * the method returns the libraries that are included in the Class-Path section of 
	 * the MANIFEST.MF file. If a referenced JAR file has further references to other library 
	 * entries, they are processed recursively and added to the list. For entry kinds other 
	 * than {@link IClasspathEntry#CPE_LIBRARY}, this method returns an empty array.
	 * <p> 
	 * If a referenced entry has already been stored 
	 * in the given project's .classpath, the stored attributes are populated in the corresponding
	 * referenced entry. For more details on storing referenced entries see
	 * see {@link IJavaProject#setRawClasspath(IClasspathEntry[], IClasspathEntry[], IPath,
