	/** 
	 * Finds the elements in this compilation unit that correspond to
	 * the given element.
	 * An element A corresponds to an element B if:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>A has the same element name as B.
	 * <li>If A is a method, A must have the same number of arguments as
	 *     B and the simple names of the argument types must be equals.
	 * <li>The parent of A corresponds to the parent of B recursively up to
	 *     their respective compilation units.
	 * <li>A exists.
	 * </ul>
	 * Returns <code>null</code> if no such java elements can be found
	 * or if the given element is not included in a compilation unit.
	 * 
	 * @param element the given element
	 * @return the found elements in this compilation unit that correspond to the given element
	 * @since 2.0
