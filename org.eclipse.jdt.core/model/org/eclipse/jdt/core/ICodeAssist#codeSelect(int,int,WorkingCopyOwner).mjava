	 * Returns the Java elements corresponding to the given selected text in this compilation unit. 
	 * The <code>offset</code> is the 0-based index of the first selected character. 
	 * The <code>length</code> is the number of selected characters.
	 * It considers types in the working copies with the given owner first. In other words, 
	 * the owner's working copies will take precedence over their original compilation units
	 * in the workspace.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that if the <code>length</code> is 0 and the <code>offset</code> is inside an identifier 
	 * or the index just after an identifier then this identifier is considered as the selection.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that if a working copy is empty, it will be as if the original compilation
	 * unit had been deleted.

	 * @param offset the given offset position
	 * @param length the number of selected characters
	 * @param owner the owner of working copies that take precedence over their original compilation units
