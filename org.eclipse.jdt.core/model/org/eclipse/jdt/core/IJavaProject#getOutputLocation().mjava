	 * <p>
	 * The default output location is where class files are ordinarily generated
	 * (and resource files, copied). Each source classpath entry can also
	 * specify an output location for the generated class files (and copied
	 * resource files) corresponding to compilation units under that source
	 * folder. This makes it possible to arrange generated class files for
	 * different source folders in different output folders, and not
	 * necessarily the default output folder. This means that the generated
	 * class files for the project may end up scattered across several folders,
	 * rather than all in the default output folder (which is more standard).
