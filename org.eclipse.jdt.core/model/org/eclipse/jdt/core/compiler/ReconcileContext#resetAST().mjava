/**
 * Resets the AST carried by this context.
 * A compilation participant that modifies the environment that would result in different

 * <p>
 * Note that resetting the AST will not restart the reconcile process. Only further 
 * participants will see the new AST. Thus participants running before the one that
 * resets the AST will have a stale view of the AST and its problems. Use 
 * the compilation participant extension point to order the participants.
