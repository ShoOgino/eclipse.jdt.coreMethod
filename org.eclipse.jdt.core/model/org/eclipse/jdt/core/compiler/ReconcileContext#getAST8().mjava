/**
 * Returns a resolved AST with {@link AST#JLS8 JLS8} level.

 * Creates one if none exists yet.
 * Returns <code>null</code> if the current state of the working copy
 * doesn't allow the AST to be created (e.g. if the working copy's content
 * cannot be parsed).
 * <p>
 * If the AST level requested during reconciling is not {@link AST#JLS8}
 * or if binding resolutions was not requested, then a different AST is created.
 * Note that this AST does not become the current AST and it is only valid for
 * the requestor.

 * <li> The working copy does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
 * </ul>
 * @deprecated JLS8 has been deprecated. This method has been replaced by {@link #getAST(int)} which returns an AST
 * with the given level.
