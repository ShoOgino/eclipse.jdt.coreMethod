	/**
	 * Answers the set of classpath entries this container is mapping to.
	 * <p>
	 * The set of entries associated with a classpath container may contain any of the following:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> library entries (<code>CPE_LIBRARY</code>) </li>
	 * <li> project entries (<code>CPE_PROJECT</code>) </li>
	 * </ul>
	 * A classpath container can neither reference further classpath containers
	 * or classpath variables.
	 * <p>
	 * A library entry can reference other libraries through the Class-Path section of the JAR's MANIFEST.MF file. If
	 * the container wants such referenced entries to be part of the classpath, the container must explicitly add them
	 * to the result.
	 * <p>
	 * This method is called by the Java model when it needs to resolve this
	 * classpath container entry into a list of library and project entries.
	 * The method is typically called exactly once for a given Java project,
	 * and the resulting list of entries cached internally by the Java model.
	 * This method must not be called by other clients.
	 * <p>
	 * There are a wide variety of conditions under which this method may be
	 * invoked. To ensure that the implementation does not interfere with
	 * correct functioning of the Java model, the implementation should use
	 * only the following Java model APIs:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#newLibraryEntry(IPath, IPath, IPath, boolean)} and variants</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#newProjectEntry(IPath, boolean)} and variants</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#create(org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspaceRoot)}</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#create(org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject)}</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#getReferencedClasspathEntries(IClasspathEntry, IJavaProject)} with <code>null</code> as project</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaModel#getJavaProjects()}</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaProject#getRawClasspath()}</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaProject#readRawClasspath()}</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaProject#getOutputLocation()}</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaProject#readOutputLocation()}</li>
	 * <li>Java element operations marked as "handle-only"</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * The effects of using other Java model APIs are unspecified.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @return IClasspathEntry[] - the classpath entries this container represents
	 * @see IClasspathEntry
