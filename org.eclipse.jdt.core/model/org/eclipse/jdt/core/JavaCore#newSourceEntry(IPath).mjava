	/**
	 * Creates and returns a new classpath entry of kind <code>CPE_SOURCE</code>
	 * for the project's source folder identified by the given absolute 
	 * workspace-relative path. This specifies that all package fragments
	 * within the root will have children of type <code>ICompilationUnit</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * The source folder is referred to using an absolute path relative to the
	 * workspace root, e.g. <code>/Project/src</code>. A project's source 
	 * folders are located with that project. That is, a source classpath
	 * entry specifying the path <code>/P1/src</code> is only usable for
	 * project <code>P1</code>.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The source classpath entry created by this method includes all source
	 * files below the given workspace-relative path. To selectively exclude
	 * some of these source files, use the factory method 
	 * <code>JavaCore.newSourceEntry(IPath,IPath[])</code> instead.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that all sources/binaries inside a project are contributed as a whole through
	 * a project entry (see <code>JavaCore.newProjectEntry</code>). Particular
	 * source entries cannot be selectively exported.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param path the absolute workspace-relative path of a source folder
	 * @return a new source classpath entry with not exclusion patterns
