	/**
	 * Creates and returns a new classpath entry of kind <code>CPE_SOURCE</code> for the project's source folder 
	 * identified by the given absolute path. This specifies that all package fragments within the root will 
	 * have children of type <code>ICompilationUnit</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * The source folder is referred to using an absolute path relative to the workspace root, e.g. <code>/Project/src</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * A source entry is used to set up the internal source layout of a project, and cannot be used out of the
	 * context of the containing project (a source entry <code>/Proj1/src</code> cannot be used on the classpath of 
	 * a different project <code>/Proj2</code>).
	 * <p>
	 * A particular source entry cannot be exported to other projects. All sources/binaries inside a project are
	 * contributed as a whole through a project entry (see <code>JavaCore.newProjectEntry</code>).
	 * <p>
	 * In order to exclude resources from the source folder, the factory method <code>JavaCore.newSourceEntry(IPath,IPath[])
	 * </code> should be used instead.
	 * 
	 * @param path the absolute path of a source folder
	 * @return a new source classpath entry
	 * @see #newSourceEntry(IPath,IPath[])
