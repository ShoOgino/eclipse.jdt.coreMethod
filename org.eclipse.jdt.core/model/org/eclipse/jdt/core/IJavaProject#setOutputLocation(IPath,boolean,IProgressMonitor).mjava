	 * Sets the default output location of this project to the location
	 * described by the given workspace-relative absolute path, and sets
	 * whether the output folder should be scrubbed before full builds.
	 * <p>
	 * The default output location is where class files are ordinarily generated
	 * (and resource files, copied). Each source classpath entries can also
	 * specify an output location for the generated class files (and copied
	 * resource files) corresponding to compilation units under that source
	 * folder. This makes it possible to arrange that generated class files for
	 * different source folders to end up in different output folders, and not
	 * necessarily the default output folder. This means that the generated
	 * class files for the project may end up scattered across several folders,
	 * rather than all in the default output folder (which is more standard).

	 *  <li> The path is nested inside a package fragment root of this project (<code>INVALID_PATH</code>)
