	/**
	 * Returns whether this Java element exists in the model.
	 * <p>
	 * Java elements are handle objects that may or may not be backed by an
	 * actual element. Java elements that are backed by an actual element are
	 * said to "exist", and this method returns <code>true</code>. For Java
	 * elements that are not working copies, it is always the case that if the
	 * element exists, then its parent also exists (provided it has one) and
	 * includes the element as one of its children. It is therefore possible
	 * to navigated to an existing Java element from the root of the Java model
	 * along a chain of existing Java elements. On the other hand, working
	 * copies are said to exist until they are destroyed (with
	 * <code>IWorkingCopy.destory</code>). And unlike regular Java elements, a
	 * working copy never shows up among the children of its parent element
	 * (which may or may not exist).
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @return <code>true</code> if this element exists in the Java model, and
	 * <code>false</code> if this element does not exist
