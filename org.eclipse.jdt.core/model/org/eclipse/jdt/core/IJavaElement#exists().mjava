	/**
	 * Returns whether this Java element exists in the model.
	 * <p>
	 * Java elements are handle objects that may or may not be backed by an
	 * actual element. Java elements that are backed by an actual element are
	 * said to "exist", and this method returns <code>true</code>. 
	 * It is always the case that if a given Java element exists, then its
	 * parent also exists (provided it has one). All Java elements that exist
	 * can be navigated to from the root of the Java model along a chain of
	 * existing Java elements.
	 * TODO: The above is not true for working copies: A working copy on a .java
	 * file that is not on the classpath exists but its parent (a package fragment) does
	 * not exist. Also a working copy (even on the classpath) cannot be navigated to
	 * from the root of the Java model.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @return <code>true</code> if this element exists in the Java model, and
	 * <code>false</code> if this element does not exist
