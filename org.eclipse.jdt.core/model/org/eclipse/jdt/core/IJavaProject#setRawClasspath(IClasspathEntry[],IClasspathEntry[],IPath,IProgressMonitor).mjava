	/**
	 * Works similar to {@link #setRawClasspath(IClasspathEntry[], IPath, IProgressMonitor)} and 
	 * additionally allows persisting the given array of referenced entries for this project.
	 * The referenced entries and their attributes are stored in the .classpath file of this 
	 * project. For details on referenced entries, see 
	 * {@link JavaCore#getReferencedClasspathEntries(IClasspathEntry, IJavaProject)}
	 * and {@link IClasspathEntry#getReferencingEntry()}.
	 * <p>
	 * Since the referenced entries are stored in the .classpath file, clients can store additional 
	 * information that belong to these entries and retrieve them across sessions, though the referenced
	 * entries themselves may not be present in the raw classpath. By passing a <code>null</code>
	 * referencedEntries, clients can choose not to modify the already persisted referenced entries,
	 * which is fully equivalent to {@link #setRawClasspath(IClasspathEntry[], IPath, IProgressMonitor)}.
	 * If an empty array is passed as referencedEntries, the already persisted referenced entries, 
	 * if any, will be cleared. 
	 * </p> <p>
	 * If there are duplicates of a referenced entry or if any of the <code>referencedEntries</code> 
	 * is already present in the raw classpath(<code>entries</code>) those referenced entries will 
	 * be excluded and not be persisted.
	 *</p>
	 * @param entries a list of classpath entries
	 * @param referencedEntries the list of referenced classpath entries to be persisted
	 * @param outputLocation the default output location
	 * @param monitor the given progress monitor
	 * @exception JavaModelException if the classpath could not be set. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This Java element does not exist (ELEMENT_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</li>
	 * <li> The classpath is being modified during resource change event notification (CORE_EXCEPTION)
	 * <li> The classpath failed the validation check as defined by {@link JavaConventions#validateClasspath(IJavaProject, IClasspathEntry[], IPath)}
	 * </ul>
