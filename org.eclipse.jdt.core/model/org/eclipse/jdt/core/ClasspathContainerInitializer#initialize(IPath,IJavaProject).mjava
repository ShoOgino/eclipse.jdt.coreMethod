     * Binds a classpath container to a <code>IClasspathContainer</code> for a given project,
     * or silently fails if unable to do so.
     * <p>
     * A container is identified by a container path, which must be formed of two segments.
     * The first segment is used as a unique identifier (which this initializer did register onto), and
     * the second segment can be used as an additional hint when performing the resolution.
     * <p>
     * The initializer is invoked if a container path needs to be resolved for a given project, and no
     * value for it was recorded so far. The implementation of the initializer can set the corresponding 
     * container using <code>JavaCore#setClasspathContainer</code>.
     * <p>
     * @param containerPath - a two-segment path (ID/hint) identifying the container that needs 
     * 	to be resolved
     * @param project - the Java project in which context the container is to be resolved.
     *    This allows generic containers to be bound with project specific values.
     * 
     * @see JavaCore#getClasspathContainer(IPath, IJavaProject)
     * @see JavaCore#setClasspathContainer(IPath, IJavaProject[], IClasspathContainer[], IProgressMonitor)
