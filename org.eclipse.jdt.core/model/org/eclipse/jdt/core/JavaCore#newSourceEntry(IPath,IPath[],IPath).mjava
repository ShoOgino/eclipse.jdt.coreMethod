	/**
	 * TODO: check spec for specific output location
	 * Creates and returns a new classpath entry of kind <code>CPE_SOURCE</code>
	 * for the project's source folder identified by the given absolute 
	 * workspace-relative path but excluding all source files with paths
	 * matching any of the given patterns, and associated with a specific output location
	 * (i.e. ".class" files are not going to the project default output location). 
	 * All package fragments within the root will have children of type 
	 * <code>ICompilationUnit</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * The source folder is referred to using an absolute path relative to the
	 * workspace root, e.g. <code>/Project/src</code>. A project's source 
	 * folders are located with that project. That is, a source classpath
	 * entry specifying the path <code>/P1/src</code> is only usable for
	 * project <code>P1</code>.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The source classpath entry created by this method includes all source
	 * files below the given workspace-relative path except for those matched
	 * by one (or more) of the given exclusion patterns. Each exclusion pattern
	 * is represented by a relative path, which is interpreted as relative to
	 * the source folder. For example, if the source folder path is 
	 * <code>/Project/src</code> and the exclusion pattern is 
	 * <code>com/xyz/tests/&#42;&#42;</code>, then source files
	 * like <code>/Project/src/com/xyz/Foo.java</code>
	 * and <code>/Project/src/com/xyz/utils/Bar.java</code> would be included,
	 * whereas <code>/Project/src/com/xyz/tests/T1.java</code>
	 * and <code>/Project/src/com/xyz/tests/quick/T2.java</code> would be
	 * excluded. Exclusion patterns can contain can contain '**', '*' or '?'
	 * wildcards; see <code>IClasspathEntry.getExclusionPatterns</code>
	 * for the full description of the syntax and semantics of exclusion
	 * patterns.
	 * </p>
	 * If the empty list of exclusion patterns is specified, the source folder
	 * will automatically include all resources located inside the source
	 * folder. In that case, the result is entirely equivalent to using the
	 * factory method <code>JavaCore.newSourceEntry(IPath)</code>. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Additionally, a source entry can be associated with a specific output location. 
	 * By doing so, the Java builder will ensure that the generated ".class" files will 
	 * be issued inside this output location, as opposed to be generated into the 
	 * project default output location (when output location is <code>null</code>). 
	 * Note that multiple source entries may target the same output location.
	 * The output location is referred to using an absolute path relative to the 
	 * workspace root, e.g. <code>"/Project/bin"</code>, it must be located inside 
	 * the same project as the source folder.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Also note that all sources/binaries inside a project are contributed as a whole through
	 * a project entry (see <code>JavaCore.newProjectEntry</code>). Particular
	 * source entries cannot be selectively exported.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param path the absolute workspace-relative path of a source folder
	 * @param exclusionPatterns the possibly empty list of exclusion patterns
	 *    represented as relative paths
	 * @param outputLocation the specific output location for this source entry (<code>null</code> if using project default ouput location)
	 * @return a new source classpath entry with the given exclusion patterns
