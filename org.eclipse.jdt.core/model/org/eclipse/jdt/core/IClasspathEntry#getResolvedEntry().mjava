	/**
	 * This is a helper method, which returns the resolved classpath entry denoted 
	 * by an entry (if it is a variable entry). It is obtained by resolving the variable 
	 * reference in the first segment. Returns <code>null</code> if unable to resolve using 
	 * the following algorithm:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> if variable segment cannot be resolved, returns <code>null</code></li>
	 * <li> finds a project, JAR or binary folder in the workspace at the resolved path location</li>
	 * <li> if none finds an external JAR file or folder outside the workspace at the resolved path location </li>
	 * <li> if none returns <code>null</code></li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * Variable source attachment is also resolved and recorded in the resulting classpath entry.
	 * <p>
	 * @return the resolved library or project classpath entry, or <code>null</code>
	 *   if the given path could not be resolved to a classpath entry
	 *	<p> 
	 * Note that this deprecated API doesn't handle CPE_CONTAINER entries.
	 * 
	 * @deprecated - use JavaCore.getResolvedClasspathEntry(...)
