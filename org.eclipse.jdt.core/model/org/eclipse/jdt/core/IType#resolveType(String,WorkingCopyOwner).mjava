	/**
	 * Resolves the given type name within the context of this type (depending on the type hierarchy 
	 * and its imports) and using the given owner's working copies, considering types in the 
	 * working copies with the given owner. In other words, the owner's working copies will take 
	 * precedence over their original compilation units in the workspace.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that if a working copy is empty, it will be as if the original compilation
	 * unit had been deleted.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>Multiple answers might be found in case there are ambiguous matches.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Each matching type name is decomposed as an array of two strings, the first denoting the package
	 * name (dot-separated) and the second being the type name. The package name is empty if it is the
	 * default package. The type name is the type qualified name using a '.' enclosing type separator.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Returns <code>null</code> if unable to find any matching type.
	 *</p>
	 *<p>
	 * For example, resolution of <code>"Object"</code> would typically return
	 * <code>{{"java.lang", "Object"}}</code>. Another resolution that returns
	 * <code>{{"", "X.Inner"}}</code> represents the inner type Inner defined in type X in the 
	 * default package.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param typeName the given type name
	 * @param owner the owner of working copies that take precedence over their original compilation units
	 * @exception JavaModelException if code resolve could not be performed. 
	 * @return the resolved type names or <code>null</code> if unable to find any matching type
	 * @see #getTypeQualifiedName(char)
