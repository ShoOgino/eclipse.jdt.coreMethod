/**
 * Returns a java search scope limited to the given java elements.
 * The java elements resulting from a search with this scope will
 * be children of the given elements.
 * <p>
 * If an element is an IJavaProject, then the project's source folders, 
 * its jars (external and internal) and its referenced projects (with their source 
 * folders and jars, recursively) will be included.
 * If an element is an IPackageFragmentRoot, then only the package fragments of 
 * this package fragment root will be included.
 * If an element is an IPackageFragment, then only the compilation unit and class 
 * files of this package fragment will be included. Subpackages will NOT be 
 * included.</p>
 * <p>
 * In other words, this is equivalent to using SearchEngine.createJavaSearchScope(elements, true).</p>
 *
 * @param elements the java elements the scope is limited to
 * @return a new java search scope
 * @since 2.0
