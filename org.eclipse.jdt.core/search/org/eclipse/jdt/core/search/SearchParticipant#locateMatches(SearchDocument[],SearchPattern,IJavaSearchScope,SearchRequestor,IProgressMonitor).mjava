	 * Locates the matches in the given documents using the given search pattern

	 * matching the given pattern in the given search scope.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that a participant (e.g. a JSP participant) can pre-process the contents of the given documents,
	 * create its own documents whose contents are Java compilation units and delegate the match location
	 * to the default participant (see {@link SearchEngine#getDefaultSearchParticipant()}). Passing its own
	 * {@link SearchRequestor} this participant can then map the match positions back to the original
	 * contents, create its own matches and report them to the original requestor.
	 * </p><p>
	 * Implementors of this method should check the progress monitor
	 * for cancelation when it is safe and appropriate to do so.  The cancelation
	 * request should be propagated to the caller by throwing
	 * <code>OperationCanceledException</code>.
