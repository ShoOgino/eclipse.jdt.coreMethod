/**
 * Returns a java search scope limited to the given resources.
 * The java elements resulting from a search with this scope will
 * have their underlying resource included in or equals to one of the given
 * resources.
 * <p>
 * Resources must not overlap, e.g. one cannot include a folder and its children.
 * </p>
 * Projects are treated specialy: if a project is included in the search scope, 
 * its source folders, the jars internal to the project and its external jars 
 * are added for free. Jars that are contained in other projects must be included 
 * explicitely.
 *
 * @param resources the resources the scope is limited to
 * @return a new java search scope
