/**
 * Answers true if a sub-pattern matches the sub-part of the given name using
 * CamelCase rules, or false otherwise.  char[] CamelCase matching does NOT
 * accept explicit wild-cards '*' and '?' and is inherently case sensitive. 
 * Can match only subset of name/pattern, considering end positions as non-inclusive.
 * The sub-pattern is defined by the patternStart and patternEnd positions.
 * <p>
 * CamelCase denotes the convention of writing compound names without spaces,
 * and capitalizing every term. This function recognizes both upper and lower
 * CamelCase, depending whether the leading character is capitalized or not.
 * The leading part of an upper CamelCase pattern is assumed to contain a
 * sequence of capitals which are appearing in the matching name; e.g. 'NPE' will
 * match 'NullPointerException', but not 'NewPerfData'. A lower CamelCase pattern
 * uses a lowercase first character. In Java, type names follow the upper
 * CamelCase convention, whereas method or field names follow the lower
 * CamelCase convention.
 * <p>
 * The pattern may contain lowercase characters, which will be matched in a case
 * sensitive way. These characters must appear in sequence in the name.
 * For instance, 'NPExcep' will match 'NullPointerException', but not
 * 'NullPointerExCEPTION' or 'NuPoEx' will match 'NullPointerException', but not
 * 'NoPointerException'.
 * <p>
 * Digit characters are treated in a special way. They can be used in the pattern
 * but are not always considered as leading character. For instance, both
 * 'UTF16DSS' and 'UTFDSS' patterns will match 'UTF16DocumentScannerSupport'.
 * <p>
 * Digit characters are treated in a special way. They can be used in the pattern
 * but are not always considered as leading character. For instance, both
 * 'UTF16DSS' and 'UTFDSS' patterns will match 'UTF16DocumentScannerSupport'.
 * <p>
 * This method allows prefix match in Camel Case (see
 * {@link #camelCaseMatch(String, int, int, String, int, int, boolean)}).
