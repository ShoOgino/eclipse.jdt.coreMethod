 * @param packageName the dot-separated name of the package of the interface
 * @param simpleTypeName the simple name of the interface
 * @param enclosingTypeNames if the interface is a member type, 
 *          the simple names of the enclosing types from the outer-most to the
 *          direct parent of the interface (e.g. if the interface is x.y.A$B$I then
 *          the enclosing types are [A, B]. This is an empty array if the interface
 *          is a top-level type.
 * @param path the full path to the resource containing the interface. If the resource is a .class file
 *          or a .java file, this is the full path in the workspace to this resource. If the
 *          resource is a .zip or .jar file, this is the full OS path to this file.
