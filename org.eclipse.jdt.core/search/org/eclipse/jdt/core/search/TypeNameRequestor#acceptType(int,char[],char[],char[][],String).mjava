	/**
	 * Accepts a top-level or a member type.
	 *
	 * @param modifiers the modifier flags of the type. Note that for source type,
	 *		these flags may slightly differ from thoses get after resolution.
	 *		For example an interface defined by <code>interface A {}</code>,
	 *		although obviously public, will be returned false by <code>Flags.isPublic(modifiers)</code>
	 *		due to the fact that its declaration does not explicitely define public flag.
	 *		@see org.eclipse.jdt.core.Flags
	 * @param packageName the dot-separated name of the package of the type
	 * @param simpleTypeName the simple name of the type
	 * @param enclosingTypeNames if the type is a member type, 
	 *          the simple names of the enclosing types from the outer-most to the
	 *          direct parent of the type (for example, if the class is x.y.A$B$C then
	 *          the enclosing types are [A, B]. This is an empty array if the type
	 *          is a top-level type.
	 * @param path the full path to the resource containing the type. If the resource is a .class file
	 *          or a .java file, this is the full path in the workspace to this resource. If the
	 *          resource is an archive (that is, a .zip or .jar file), the path is composed of 2 paths separated
	 *		 	 by <code>IJavaSearchScope.JAR_FILE_ENTRY_SEPARATOR</code>: 
	 *			 the first path is the full OS path to the archive (if it is an external archive), 
	 *			 or the workspace relative <code>IPath</code> to the archive (if it is an internal archive), 
	 * 		 the second path is the path to the resource inside the archive.
