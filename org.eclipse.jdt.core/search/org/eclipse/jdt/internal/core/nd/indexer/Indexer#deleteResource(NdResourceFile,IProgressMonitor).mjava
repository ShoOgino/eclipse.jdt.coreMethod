	 * Performs a non-atomic delete of the given resource file. First, it marks the file as being invalid

	 * Once all the children are deleted, the resource itself is deleted. The result on the database is exactly
	 * the same as if the caller had called toDelete.delete(), but doing it this way ensures that a write lock
	 * will never be held for a nontrivial amount of time.
