	/**
	 * Invokes the delete method on all the fields of the object, and calls deleteFields on the superclass' type (if
	 * any). Does not perform any higher-level cleanup operations. This is only intended to be called from the
	 * deleteFields methods of a subtype or the delete method of this class.
	 * <p>
	 * When destructing a type with a superclass, the correct destruction behavior is:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>External code invokes the delete method on ITypeFactory
	 * <li>The ITypeFactory.delete method calls an instance method on the class (typically called T#delete()), which
	 * performs high-level deletion operations (if any).
	 * <li>T.delete also calls T.super.delete() (if any)
	 * <li>ITypeFactory.delete calls ITypeFactory.deleteFields, which performs low-level deletion operations on the
	 * fields, then calls ITypeFactory.deleteFields on the base type.
	 * </ul>
