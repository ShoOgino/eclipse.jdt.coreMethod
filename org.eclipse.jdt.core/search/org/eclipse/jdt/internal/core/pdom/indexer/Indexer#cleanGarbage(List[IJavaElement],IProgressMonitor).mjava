		// means that operations which temporarily cause a file to become unreferenced will run really slowly

		// We should also eagerly clean up any partially-indexed files we discover during the scan. That is,
		// if we discover a file with a timestamp of 0, it indicates that the indexer or all of Eclipse crashed
		// midway through indexing the file. Such garbage should be cleaned up as soon as possible, since it
		// will never be useful.
