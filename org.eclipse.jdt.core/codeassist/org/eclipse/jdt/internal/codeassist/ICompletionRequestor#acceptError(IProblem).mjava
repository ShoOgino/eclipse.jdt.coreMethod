 *		In case an error got signaled, no other completions might be available,
 *		therefore the problem message should be presented to the user.
 *		The source positions of the problem are related to the source where it was
 *		detected (might be in another compilation unit, if it was indirectly requested
 *		during the code assist process).
 *      Note: the problem knows its originating file name.
