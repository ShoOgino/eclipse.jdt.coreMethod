     * in the Java Language Specification, Third Edition (JLS3).
     * JLS3 is a superset of all earlier versions of the
     * Java language, and the 3.0 API can be used to manipulate
     * programs written in all versions of the Java language
     * up to and including J2SE 1.5.

     * @deprecated Do not use at this time. The 1.5 compiler support is missing.
     * TBD (jeem) - remove deprecation when 1.5 parser and compiler support available
