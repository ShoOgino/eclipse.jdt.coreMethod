	 * The implementation of <code>AnnotationTypeMemberDeclaration.resolveBinding</code> 
	 * forwards to this method. How the declaration resolves is often a 
	 * function of the context in which the declaration node is embedded as well
	 * as the declaration subtree itself.

	 * under discussion in JSR-175 and under consideration for inclusion
	 * in the 1.5 release of J2SE. The support here is therefore tentative
	 * and subject to change.
