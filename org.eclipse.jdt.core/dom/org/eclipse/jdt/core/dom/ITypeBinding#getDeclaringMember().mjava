	 *   answers the binding of that declaring method.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>Otherwise, if the local type (an anonymous class in this case) is declared
	 *   in the initializer of a field, answers the binding of that declaring field.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>Otherwise, if the local type is declared in a static initializer or
	 *   an instance initializer, a method binding is returned to represent that initializer
	 *   (selector is an empty string in this case).
