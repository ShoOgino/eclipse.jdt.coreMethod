	/**
	 * Returns the live list of extended operands.
	 * <p>
	 * The extended operands is the preferred way of representing deeply nested
	 * expressions of the form <code>L op R op R2 op R3...</code> where
	 * the same operator appears between all the operands (the most
	 * common case being lengthy string concatenation expressions). Using
	 * the extended operands keeps the trees from getting too deep; this
	 * decreases the risk is running out of thread stack space at runtime
	 * when traversing such trees.
	 * ((a + b) + c) + d would be translated to:
	 * 	leftOperand: a
	 * 	rightOperand: b
	 * 	extendedOperands: {c, d}
	 * 	operator: +
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @return the live list of extended operands
