	/**
	 * Parses the given string as a Java compilation unit and creates and 
	 * returns a corresponding abstract syntax tree.
	 * <p>
	 * The returned compilation unit node is the root node of a new AST.
	 * Each node in the subtree carries source range(s) information relating back
	 * to positions in the given source string (the given source string itself
	 * is not remembered with the AST). If a syntax error is detected while
	 * parsing, the relevant node(s) of the tree will be flagged as 
	 * <code>MALFORMED</code>.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If <code>resolveBindings</code> is <code>true</code>, the various names
	 * and types appearing in the compilation unit can be resolved to "bindings"
	 * by calling the <code>resolveBinding</code> methods. These bindings 
	 * draw connections between the different parts of a program, and 
	 * generally afford a more powerful vantage point for clients who wish to
	 * analyze a program's structure more deeply. These bindings come at a 
	 * considerable cost in both time and space, however, and should not be
	 * requested frivilously. The additional space is not reclaimed until the 
	 * AST, all its nodes, and all its bindings become garbage. So it is very
	 * important to not retain any of these objects longer than absolutely
	 * necessary. Note that bindings can only be resolved while the AST remains
	 * in its original unmodified state. Once the AST is modified, all 
	 * <code>resolveBinding</code> methods return <code>null</code>.
	 * If <code>resolveBindings</code> is <code>false</code>, the analysis 
	 * does not go beyond parsing and building the tree, and all 
	 * <code>resolveBinding</code> methods return <code>null</code> from the 
	 * outset.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param unit the Java model compilation unit whose source code is to be parsed
	 * @param resolveBindings <code>true</code> if bindings are wanted, 
	 *   and <code>false</code> if bindings are not of interest
	 * @return the compilation unit node
	 * @see ASTNode#getFlags
	 * @see ASTNode#MALFORMED
