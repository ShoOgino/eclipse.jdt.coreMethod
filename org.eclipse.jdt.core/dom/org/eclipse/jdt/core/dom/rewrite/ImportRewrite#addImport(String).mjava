	 * Adds a new import to the rewriter's record and returns a name - single member name if
	 * import is successful, else qualified name. The type binding can only be an array or non-generic type.
	 * 	<p>
 	 * No imports are added for types that are already known. If a import for a type is recorded to be removed, this record is discarded instead.

	 * in any way by this method; rather, the rewriter just records that a new import has been added.
	 * </p>
	 * @param qualifiedTypeName the qualified type name of the type to be added
	 * @return returns either the simple member name if the import was successful or else the qualified name if
	 * an import conflict prevented the import.
