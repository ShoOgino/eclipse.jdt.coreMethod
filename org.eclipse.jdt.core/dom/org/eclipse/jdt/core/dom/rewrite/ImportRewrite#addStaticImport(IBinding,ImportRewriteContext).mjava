 	 * No imports are added for members that are already known. If a import for a type is recorded to be removed, this record is discarded instead.

	 * in any way by this method; rather, the rewriter just records that a new import has been added.
	 * </p>
	 * @param binding The binding of the static field or method to be added.
	 * @param context an optional context that knows about members visible in the current scope or <code>null</code>
	 * to use the default context only using the available imports.
	 * @return either the simple member name if the import was successful or else the qualified name if
	 * an import conflict prevented the import
	 * @throws IllegalArgumentException an {@link IllegalArgumentException} is thrown if the binding is not a static field
	 * or method.
