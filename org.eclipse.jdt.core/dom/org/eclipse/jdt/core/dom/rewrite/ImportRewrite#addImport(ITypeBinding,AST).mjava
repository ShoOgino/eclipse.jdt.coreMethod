	/**
	 * Adds a new import to the rewriter's record and returns a {@link Type} that can be used
	 * in the code. The type binding can be an array binding, type variable or wildcard.
	 * If the binding is a generic type, the type parameters are ignored. For parameterized types, also the type
	 * arguments are processed and imports added if necessary. Anonymous types inside type arguments are normalized to their base type, wildcard
	 * of wildcards are ignored.
	 * 	<p>
 	 * No imports are added for types that are already known. If a import for a type is recorded to be removed, this record is discarded instead.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The content of the compilation unit itself is actually not modified
	 * in any way by this method; rather, the rewriter just records that a new import has been added.
	 * </p>
	 * @param binding the signature of the type to be added.
	 * @param ast the AST to create the returned type for.
	 * @return returns a type to which the type binding can be assigned to. The returned type contains is unqualified
	 * when an import could be added or was already known. It is fully qualified, if an import conflict prevented the import.
