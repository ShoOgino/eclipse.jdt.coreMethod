	 * <li>
	 * <code>QualifiedType(SimpleType(SimpleName("A")),SimpleName("B"))</code>
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * <code>SimpleType(QualifiedName(SimpleName("A"),SimpleName("B")))</code>

	 * parser cannot always determine this. Clients should be prepared to handle
	 * either rather than make assumptions. (Note also that the first form
	 * became possible as of JLS3; only the second form existed in the 
	 * JLS2 API.)
