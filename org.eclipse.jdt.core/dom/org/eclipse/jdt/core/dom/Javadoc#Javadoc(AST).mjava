	 * Creates a new AST node for a doc comment owned by the given AST.
	 * The new node has an empty list of fragments (and, for backwards
	 * compatability, an unspecified, but legal, doc comment string).
	 * <p>
	 * N.B. This constructor is package-private; all subclasses must be 
	 * declared in the same package; clients are unable to declare 
	 * additional subclasses.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param ast the AST that is to own this node
