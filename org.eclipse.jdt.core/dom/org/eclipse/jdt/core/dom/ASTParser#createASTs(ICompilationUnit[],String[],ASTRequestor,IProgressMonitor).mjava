	/**
     * Creates ASTs for a set of compilation units.
     * When bindings are being resolved, processing a
     * batch of compilation units is more efficient because much
     * of the work involved in resolving bindings can be shared.
     * <p>
     * When bindings are being resolved, all compilation units must
     * come from the same Java project, which must be set beforehand
     * with <code>setProject</code>.
     * The compilation units are processed one at a time in no
     * specified order. For each of the compilation units in turn,
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><code>ASTParser.createAST</code> is called to parse it
	 * and create a corresponding AST. The calls to
	 * <code>ASTParser.createAST</code> all employ the same settings.</li>
	 * <li><code>ASTRequestor.acceptAST</code> is called passing
	 * the compilation unit and the corresponding AST to 
	 * <code>requestor</code>.
	 * </li>
	 * </ul> 
     * Note only ASTs from the given compilation units are reported
     * to the requestor. If additional compilation units are required to
     * resolve the original ones, the corresponding ASTs are <b>not</b>
     * reported to the requestor.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>bindingKeys</code> parameter specifies bindings keys
     * ({@link IBinding#getKey()}) that are to be looked up for the compilation
     * units are being processed. These binding keys must be for constructs
     * declared within the compilation units. The keys and corresponding bindings are
     * passed to <code>ASTRequestor.acceptBinding</code>.
     * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * [TODO (jerome) issue: Verify that the preceding para about the bindings is accurate.]
	 * </p>
     * <p>
     * A successful call to this method returns all settings to their
     * default values so the object is ready to be reused.
     * </p>
     * <p>
	 * Note that this API is under development and subject to change without notice.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * [TODO (jerome) issue: It might be simpler to say that createASTs always
	 * resolves bindings. There is no benefit to use when not resolving bindings.
	 * This would simplify the spec.]
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * [TODO (jerome) issue: Does this work with all kinds of ASTParsers, and all
	 * combinations of ASTParser options? I suspect not. I think
	 * it really only makes sense for setKind(K_COMPILATION_UNIT),
	 * setSourceRange(0,-1), and no setFocalPosition.]
	 * </p>
