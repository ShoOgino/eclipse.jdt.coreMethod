	/**
	 * There is no special definition of equality for bindings; equality is
	 * simply object identity.  Within the context of a single cluster of
	 * bindings (produced by the same call to an {@code ASTParser#create*(*)} method),
	 * each binding is represented by a separate object. However,
	 * between different clusters of bindings, the binding objects may or may
	 * not be different; in these cases, the client should compare bindings
	 * using {@link #isEqualTo(IBinding)}, which is functionally equivalent to
	 * checking their keys for equality.
	 * <p>
	 * Since JLS8, type bindings can contain {@link ITypeBinding#getTypeAnnotations() type annotations}.
	 * Note that type bindings that denote the same un-annotated type have the same {@link #getKey() key},
	 * but they are not identical if they contain different type annotations.
	 * Type bindings that contain the same type annotations may or may not be identical.
	 * </p>

	 * @param obj {@inheritDoc}
