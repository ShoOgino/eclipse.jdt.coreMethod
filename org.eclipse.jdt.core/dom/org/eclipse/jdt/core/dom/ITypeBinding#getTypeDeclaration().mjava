	/**
	 * Returns the binding for the type declaration corresponding to this type
	 * binding.
	 * <p>For parameterized types ({@link #isParameterizedType()})
	 * and most raw types ({@link #isRawType()}), this method returns the binding
	 * for the corresponding generic type ({@link #isGenericType()}.</p>
	 * <p>For raw member types ({@link #isRawType()}, {@link #isMember()})
	 * of a raw declaring class, the type declaration is a generic or a non-generic
	 * type.</p>
	 * <p>A different non-generic binding will be returned when one of the declaring
	 * types/methods was parameterized.</p>
	 * <p>For other type bindings, this method returns the binding for the type declaration
	 * corresponding to this type binding. In particular, for type bindings that
	 * contain a {@link #getTypeAnnotations() type annotation}, this method returns the binding for the type
	 * declaration, which does not contain the type annotations from the use site.</p>
