	/**
	 * Returns the generic type corresponding to this type binding.
	 * In the presense of generic types, some bindings correspond to
	 * types declarations in the context of a particular instance of
	 * the generic type. In those cases, this method returns
	 * the generic type binding from which this type binding
	 * was instantiated. For other type bindings, this method returns
	 * the identical type binding.
	 * Note that the resulting type binding will answer true to
	 * {@link #isGenericType()} iff this type binding would return true
	 * to either {@link #isGenericType()}, {@link #isParameterizedType()},
	 * or {@link #isRawType()}.
	 * <p>
	 * Note: Support for new language features proposed for the upcoming 1.5
	 * release of J2SE is tentative and subject to change.
