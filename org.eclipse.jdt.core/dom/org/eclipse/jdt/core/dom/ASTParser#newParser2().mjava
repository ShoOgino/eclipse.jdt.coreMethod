     * in the Java Language Specification, Second Edition (JLS2).
     * JLS2 is a superset of all earlier versions of the
     * Java language, and the 2.0 API can be used to manipulate
     * programs written in all versions of the Java language
     * up to and including J2SE 1.4. 
     *
	 * TBD (jeem) deprecated Clients should port their code to
     * use the new 3.0 API and call {@link #newParser3()}
     * instead of this method.
