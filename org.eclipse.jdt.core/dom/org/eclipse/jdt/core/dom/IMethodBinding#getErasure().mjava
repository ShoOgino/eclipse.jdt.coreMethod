	 * Returns the erasure of this method binding.
	 * Some bindings correspond to method declarations in the context of
	 * a particular instance of a generic method. In those cases, this method
	 * returns the generic method binding from which this method binding
	 * was instantiated.
	 * For other type bindings, this method returns the identical type binding.
	 * Note that the resulting method binding will answer true to
	 * {@link #isGenericMethod()} iff this method binding would return true
	 * to either {@link #isGenericMethod()}, {@link #isParameterizedMethod()},
	 * or {@link #isRawMethod()}.
	 * <p>
	 * Note: the erasure link is not a general back-link between the members
	 * of a generic type instance and the corresponding members of the
	 * generic type. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note: Support for new language features proposed for the upcoming 1.5
	 * release of J2SE is tentative and subject to change.
