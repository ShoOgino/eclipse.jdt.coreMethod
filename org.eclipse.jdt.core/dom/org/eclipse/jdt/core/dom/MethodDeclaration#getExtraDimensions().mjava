	 * Returns the number of array dimensions that appear after the parameters

	 * For example, <code>int[][][] foo()</code> has no array dimensions after
	 * the parameters; <code>int[] foo()[][]</code> has 2 array dimensions 
	 * after the parameters. In both cases, the return type is an array type
	 * with 3 dimensions.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The value is meaningless (and should be ignored) if the type is not an
	 * array type or if it exceeds the number of dimensions in the array type.
	 * The safe default value is 0; this represents the preferred syntax of the
	 * construct where all dimensions appear as part of the type.

	 * @return the number of array dimensions included after the 
	 * parameters instead of after the return type
