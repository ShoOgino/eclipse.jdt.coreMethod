	/**
	 * Parses the given string as a Java compilation unit and creates and 
	 * returns a corresponding abstract syntax tree.
	 * <p>
	 * The returned compilation unit node is the root node of a new AST.
	 * Each node in the subtree carries source range(s) information relating back
	 * to positions in the given source string (the given source string itself
	 * is not remembered with the AST). 
	 * The source range usually begins at the first character of the first token 
	 * corresponding to the node; leading whitespace and comments are <b>not</b>
	 * included. The source range usually extends through the last character of
	 * the last token corresponding to the node; trailing whitespace and
	 * comments are <b>not</b> included. There are a handful of exceptions
	 * (including compilation units and the various body declarations); the
	 * specification for these node type spells out the details.
	 * Source ranges nest properly: the source range for a child is always
	 * within the source range of its parent, and the source ranges of sibling
	 * nodes never overlap.
	 * If a syntax error is detected while parsing, the relevant node(s) of the
	 * tree will be flagged as <code>MALFORMED</code>.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method does not compute binding information; all <code>resolveBinding</code>
	 * methods applied to nodes of the resulting AST return <code>null</code>.
	 * </p>
