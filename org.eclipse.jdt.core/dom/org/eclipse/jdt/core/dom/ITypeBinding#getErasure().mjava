	/**
	 * Returns the erasure of this type binding.
	 * In the presense of generic types, some bindings correspond to
	 * types declarations in the context of a particular instance of
	 * the generic type. In those cases, this method returns
	 * the generic type binding from which this type binding
	 * was instantiated. For other type bindings, this method returns
	 * the identical type binding.
	 * <p>
	 * Note: the erasure link is not a general back-link between the members
	 * of a generic type instance and the corresponding members of the
	 * generic type.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note: Support for new language features proposed for the upcoming 1.5
	 * release of J2SE is tentative and subject to change.
