/**
 * Check if the receiver has structural changes compare to the byte array in argument.
 * Structural changes are:
 * - modifiers changes for the class, the this.fields or the this.methods
 * - signature changes for this.fields or this.methods.
 * - changes in the number of this.fields or this.methods
 * - changes for field constants
 * - changes for thrown exceptions
 * - change for the super class or any super interfaces.
 * - changes for member types name or modifiers
 * If any of these changes occurs, the method returns true. false otherwise. 
 * The synthetic fields are included and the members are not required to be sorted.
 * @param newBytes the bytes of the .class file we want to compare the receiver to
 * @return boolean Returns true is there is a structural change between the two .class files, false otherwise
