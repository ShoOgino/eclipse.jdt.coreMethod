       (4) The return type of the method to be invoked mentions at least one of the method's type parameters.
    
       We are in no position to ascertain the last two now - until the method call is fully resolved, there is no
       way to know this. Instead, we simply claim we are a poly expression if the first two stipulations are met, 
       grab the expected type with the proviso that we will not touch it until the two conditions we are unable to
       verify right now are seen to indeed hold.
