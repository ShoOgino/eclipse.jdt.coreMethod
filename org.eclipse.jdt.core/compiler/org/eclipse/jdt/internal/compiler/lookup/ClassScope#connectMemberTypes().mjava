	Our current belief based on available JCK tests is:
		inherited member types are visible as a potential superclass.
		inherited interfaces are not visible when defining a superinterface.

	Error recovery story:
		ensure the superclass is set to java.lang.Object if a problem is detected
		resolving the superclass.

	Answer false if an error was reported against the sourceType.
