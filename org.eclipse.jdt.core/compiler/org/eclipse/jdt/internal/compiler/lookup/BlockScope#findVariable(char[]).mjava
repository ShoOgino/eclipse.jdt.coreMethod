/* API
	flag is a mask of the following values VARIABLE (= FIELD or LOCAL), TYPE.
	Only bindings corresponding to the mask will be answered.

	if the VARIABLE mask is set then
		If the first name provided is a field (or local) then the field (or local) is answered
		Otherwise, package names and type names are consumed until a field is found.
		In this case, the field is answered.

	if the TYPE mask is set,
		package names and type names are consumed until the end of the input.
		Only if all of the input is consumed is the type answered

	All other conditions are errors, and a problem binding is returned.
	
	NOTE: If a problem binding is returned, senders should extract the compound name
	from the binding & not assume the problem applies to the entire compoundName.

	The VARIABLE mask has precedence over the TYPE mask.

	InvocationSite implements
		isSuperAccess(); this is used to determine if the discovered field is visible.
		setFieldIndex(int); this is used to record the number of names that were consumed.

	For example, getBinding({"foo","y","q", VARIABLE, site) will answer
	the binding for the field or local named "foo" (or an error binding if none exists).
	In addition, setFieldIndex(1) will be sent to the invocation site.
	If a type named "foo" exists, it will not be detected (and an error binding will be answered)

	IMPORTANT NOTE: This method is written under the assumption that compoundName is longer than length 1.
