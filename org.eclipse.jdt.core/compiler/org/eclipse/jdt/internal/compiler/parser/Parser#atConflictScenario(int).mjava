	/* Answer true if the parser is at a configuration where the scanner must look ahead and help disambiguate between (a) '<' as an operator and '<' as the
	   start of <type argument> and (b) the use of '(' in '(' expression ')' and '( type ')' and '(' lambda formal parameters ')'. (c) whether the token @
	   begins a Java SE5 style declaration annotation or if it begins a SE8 style type annotation. When requested thus, the scanner helps by fabricating 
	   synthetic tokens and injecting them into the stream ahead of the tokens that trigger conflicts in the absence of these artificial tokens. These 
	   manufactured token help transform the grammar into LALR(1) by splitting the states so that they have unambigious prefixes.
	   
	   We do this by claiming to the automaton that the next token seen is the (suitable) synthetic token and observing the response of the state machine. 
	   Error signals we are NOT at a conflict site, while shift or shift/reduce signals that we are. Accept is impossible, while there may be intermediate
	   reductions that are called for -- It is axiomatic of the push down automaton that corresponds to the LALR grammar that it will never shift on invalid
	   input.
	   
	   Obviously, the dry runs should not alter the parser state in any way or otherwise cause side effects. Proof by argument that this is the case:
	   
	       - The only pieces of state needed to answer the question are: this.stack, this.stateStackTop and the last action variable `act`. None of the various
	         and sundry stacks used in the AST constructions process are touched here.
	       - As we reduce, we DON'T call the semantic action functions i.e the consume* method calls are skipped.
	       - Lexer stream is left untouched.
	       - this.stateStackTop and the last action variable `act` of the automaton are readily cloned, these being primitives and changes are to the replicas.
	       - We never remove elements from the state stack here (or elsewhere for that matter). Pops are implemented by mere adjustments of the stack pointer.
	       - During this algorithm, either the stack pointer monotonically decreases or stays fixed. (The only way for the stack pointer to increase would call
	         for a shift or a shift/reduce at which point the algorithm is ready to terminate already.) This means that we don't have to replicate the stack. 
	         Pushes can be mimiced by writing to a local stackTopState variable, leaving the original stack untouched.
	         
	    Though this code looks complex, we should exit early in most situations.
