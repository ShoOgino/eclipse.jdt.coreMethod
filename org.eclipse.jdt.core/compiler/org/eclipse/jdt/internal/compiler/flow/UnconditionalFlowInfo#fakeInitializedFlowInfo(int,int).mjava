/* fakeInitializedFlowInfo: For Lambda expressions tentative analysis during overload resolution.
   We presume that any and all outer locals touched by the lambda are definitely assigned and
   effectively final. Whether they are or not is immaterial for overload analysis (errors encountered
   in the body are not supposed to influence the resolution. It is pertinent only for the eventual
   resolution/analysis post overload resolution. For lambda's the problem is that we start the control/data
   flow analysis abruptly at the start of the lambda, so we need to present a cogent world view and hence
   all this charade.
