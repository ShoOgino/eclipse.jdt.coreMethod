 * - No initialization source for now -

 *
 * Note: the initializationSource will be used in case we do need to type check
 *	against source models, and thus the only interesting use for it is field
 *  constant propagation. Therefore, the initializationSource will only be non
 *  null for final fields (so as to minimize char[] allocations).
